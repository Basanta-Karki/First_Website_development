            <p class="top">The beauty of mustang</p>
            <p class="down">Mustang is known for its trekking tours and mountain sightseeing. Elevated at an altitude of 3840 kilometres, this city is divided into two parts: Lower and Upper Mustang. I always want to travel mustang which is one of the beautiful place with stunning landscapes and rich cultural heritage. I have see beautiful places and meet friendly locals who will welcome with you with open arms. I have also enjoy the breating views of himalayas and witness the unique lifestyle of people live in this remote region. Even though it is relatively unexplored, this city is a great destination for those who want to immerse in Tibetan culture. I'm sure if you visit mustang than you will have an unforgettable memories. </p>

            <p class="top">The beauty of Pokhara</p>
            <p class="down"> Pokhara is a beautiful city located in western part of Nepal. It's known for stunning natural beauty, with the phewa Lake, the Annapurna Range, and the Machhapuchhre Mountain providing a breathtaking backdrop to the city. There are also many other attractions in pokhara, such as The World Peace Pagoda, the Devi's Fall, and the Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave. Aditionally, Pokhara is a great place for adventure activities like paragliding, trekking, and rafting. My thoughts after visiting the pokhara many times that it is one of the most beautiful and tourist attractions place where we can see beautiful temple surrounded by phewa lake and meet friendly locals who will welcome with you with open arms. Overall, it is a wonderful destination that offers something for everyone.</p>
